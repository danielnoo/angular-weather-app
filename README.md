# Front end of a weather app that is made with Angular. Data is displayed as an SVG using ngx-charts. The backend gets Toronto weather data from 5 weather APIs every day at 3pm. It records the current weather, tomorrow's forecast for 3pm, and check my database for yesterday's 3pm forecast. An accuracy rating is given using a simple formula: 10 - (difference between current weather and yesterday's forecast for today's weather). User's will eventually be able to login and place fun-money bets on which weather API they think is going to be most accurate.
